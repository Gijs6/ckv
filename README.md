At my school, everyone has to make a website for the subject CKV (*culturele en kunstzinnige vorming*, basically "culture and art") for all reports, reflections, and those kinds of things. The idea is to have a personal space everyone can update easily. Practically everyone just uses Wix because it's easy to use and requires no coding, but I built mine from scratch :D
